A collection of secure scripts to check if your passwords have been compromised in data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) password database.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Privacy-First**: Uses k-anonymity - only sends the first 5 characters of your password's hash
- üîí **Secure Input**: No password echoing to the terminal when prompted
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Bash script for Unix/Linux/macOS, PowerShell for Windows/Cross-platform
- üìä **Detailed Results**: Shows how many times a compromised password has been seen
- üé® **Color-Coded Output**: Visual feedback for safe/compromised passwords

## How It Works

1. **Hashing**: Your password is hashed using SHA-1 locally on your machine
2. **K-Anonymity**: Only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to the API
3. **Remote Lookup**: The API returns all known compromised hashes with that prefix
4. **Local Comparison**: Your script checks if your full hash appears in the returned list

This ensures your actual password never leaves your machine!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoannCalamai/PasswordBreachChecker.git
cd passwordbreachchecker
```

2. Make the scripts executable:
```bash
# For Bash script
chmod +x pwned-password-checker.sh

# For PowerShell on Unix-like systems
chmod +x pwned-password-checker.ps1
```

## Usage

### Bash Script (Linux/macOS/WSL)

```bash
# Interactive mode (secure prompt)
./pwned-password-checker.sh

# With password as argument (not recommended for sensitive passwords)
./pwned-password-checker.sh "mypassword"
```

### PowerShell Script (Windows/Cross-platform)

```powershell
# Interactive mode (secure prompt)
.\pwned-password-checker.ps1

# With password as argument (not recommended for sensitive passwords)
.\pwned-password-checker.ps1 "mypassword"

# Cross-platform PowerShell Core
pwsh .\pwned-password-checker.ps1
```

## Exit Codes

Both scripts use consistent exit codes for automation:

- `0`: Password not found in breaches (safe)
- `1`: Error (invalid usage, empty password, network error)
- `2`: Password found in breaches (compromised)

## Examples

### Safe Password
```
$ ./pwned-password-checker.sh
Enter password to check: 
Checking password against Have I Been Pwned database...
‚úÖ Good news! This password has not been found in any known data breaches.
   However, you should still use a strong, unique password.
```

### Compromised Password
```
$ ./pwned-password-checker.sh
Enter password to check: 
Checking password against Have I Been Pwned database...
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This password has been found in data breaches!
   It has appeared 3456 times in compromised password lists.
   You should change this password immediately.
```

## Automation

You can use these scripts in automated workflows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./pwned-password-checker.sh "$USER_PASSWORD"
if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "Password is compromised! Forcing password change..."
    # Add your password change logic here
fi
```

## Requirements

### Bash Script
- Bash 4.0 or higher
- `curl` command
- `sha1sum` utility
- Standard Unix tools (`cut`, `tr`, `grep`)

### PowerShell Script
- PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 6.0+
- .NET Framework or .NET Core
- Internet access for API calls

## Security Considerations

1. **Never hardcode passwords** in scripts or command line arguments
2. **Use interactive mode** when possible to avoid password exposure in process lists
3. **Clear terminal history** after use if you used command line arguments
4. **Run on trusted systems** only - avoid public or shared computers
5. **Verify HTTPS connection** to ensure secure communication with the API

## API Information

This tool uses the [Have I Been Pwned Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords):
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first5HashChars}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: Text list of hash suffixes and occurrence counts
- **Rate Limiting**: No authentication required, but please be respectful with usage
